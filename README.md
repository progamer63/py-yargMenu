# py-yargUpdater
https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG/ update checker written in python [windows only atm]\
@yarg people please let me know if this isn't allowed or something. also i used the icon from yarg itself for my updater\
\
also this uses \Documents\YARG\ to work in. if it doesn't exist it should make it. hardcoded into the program\
atm but i can change this if needed
